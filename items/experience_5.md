Experience 5: Children's Summer Camp

After experiencing the chaotic and fun first year of the university life, I told myself I needed a break badly to release the tension. At the same time, a friend from a local church reached out and asked if I can help out in a children's camp they will be hosting during the summer vacation. I was a bit hesitant at first but later changed my mind as I wanted to break out of my comfort zone and try things that I haven't tried before, which this is a great opportunity to do so.
The camp had less workload than I expected which were mostly maintaining order within the campsite and lead children to participate in camp activities. Similar to my 2 year of high school, I knew no one in the camp which made me a loner inside. Fortunately, I met another staff who was also a loner as he just got transferred here. We would hang out during the camp whenever we don't have duties. and when we can't I would just walk around and enjoy the sceneries around the camp site. This gave me many mindful moments throughout the camp and also forced my screen-time down from easily 8 hours to less than 2 hours daily, partially due to the lack of reception in the camp site but also we weren't allowed to use our phone to not negatively influence the children.
Overall, the camp was more than what I expected which not only alleviated the mental stress I had during the first year in university, but also made me realised I actually would be a good fit in child care related occupations. But of course, I'm more than happy in this UX programme right now soâ€¦maybe in the future?

TL;DR
1. What: I joined a children's summer camp as a volunteer and had some great time during the time.
2. When: The summer after first year of university, a few months ago.
3. Good: Gave me valuable mindful time without many distractions.
4. Favourite Memory: Met another friend who recently joined the staff, we hanged out together and it was so fun.
5. Didn't Enjoy: Sometime I would feel like the time there was passing too fast and didn't want to go back to reality.
6. Grade: B, really great, didn't get an A for the fact I didn't talk with more of the people in the camp and learn more about them.
