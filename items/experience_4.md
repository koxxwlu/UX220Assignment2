Experience 4: Trip to England

After my graduating from high school, I decided to go to England and visit a few of my friends. It was a fun trip overall without many things unexpected. Days before me concluding my trip, I realised another few of my friends also just arrived so we planned to meet by riding train to a town nearby and stayed over for a night, before parting and coming back to Canada. This was actually my first time travelling abroad alone and I was grateful that nothing bad happened during the entire trip.

1. What: I went to England for a few weeks as my graduation trip of high school by myself. There I hangout with many of my old friends and had some great time remembering our high school memories.
2. When: After my high school graduation, around 2 years ago.
3. Good: Met with many of my old friends who parted after high school.
4. Favourite Memory: Few days before I depart back home, another few friends arrived in the UK so we hanged out and had a sleepover.
5. Didn't Enjoy: Walking around was a bit boring as many places don't have public transits and I don't have a car.
6. Grade: A, great! Met up with old friends, visited many places, and had some great memories.
