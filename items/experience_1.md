## Experience 1: Business Bazaar

5 years ago, during the early years in high school, a few friends and me joined the Business Bazaar Programme in my school. The first one ended with profit of single digit, which is a miserable failure, so we tried again the next year. My friend, the leader of our group decided to also invite my crush and a few of her friends into our group, claiming 'they have artistic touches which we lack severely'. 
After discussion, we planned to sell hand-made crafts such as candles, stone decorations, and bookmarks. The girls worked on the craft itself, while me and my friends worked on social media marketing contents. Autumn flew by and winter arrived. We worked tirelessly to prepare our product launch in late December. Our effort finally paid off with most of the products sold out and had a profit of three digits. While not a huge amount (and the earnings had to be returned to the school), the experience was invaluable which we were all so glad how it turned out. Not sure was it a mere coincidence or just me shying from interactions, I didn't had a single word with my crush during the entire Business Bazaar. Well, maybe that's fate, as I later changed school a year after this programme and thought I'll never see her againâ€¦or will I?

TL;DR
1. What: Joined the Business Bazaar Programme with my friends and started a store selling handcrafted decorations.
2. When: During my early years of high school, around 5 years ago. 
3. Good: Had some great times with my friends and learnt valuable experience on running a business.
4. Favourite Memory: On the day finishing the bazaar, we went to see the concert held by the school and had some great memories on that night.
5. Didn't Enjoy: Had multiple arguments with teammates over strategies but fortunately resolved after we came to our senses.
6. Grade: B, mostly enjoyable, could be better but can't complain.
