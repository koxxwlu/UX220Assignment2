## Experience 3: Final Two Years in High School

During my final 2 years of high school, my family moved from our home town so I was transferred into another local school. There, everyone had their own circle and I had no one; no friends, no one I know, just because of the fact that they all had their social circles already and yea, I'm an introvert. As a result, I always indulge in my academic works and giving them everything I can on subject I liked. Some notable examples I recall vividly included my first visual design course which we had to design some graphics for a skateboard campaign. Since I finished the required components early, so I went ahead and made an entire 3D scene and produced a series of visuals as part of my submission. Another one was the animated short-film I made for the English class (Experience 2), while rewarded me academically, it also taught me to budget my time accordingly. For this, my parents always made fun of me for working too hard for assignment I was interested in, but not enough on the 'boring' subjects.
As I don't have lots of friends at this high school, I always walked alone. When we had class activities, I would often try to escape and go to somewhere else. It wasn't like I didn't try to make friends, I tried, but many just didn't resonate with me. I remember at the start of Grade 12, I talked a lot with one of my classmate and later figured we have many classes in common, so we would hang around together. But after winter, we got different classes so I never saw him again in school.

TL;DR
1. What: I switched schools in my final two years of high school. Since I had no social life in the new school, I can only indulge myself in working in assignments and subjects that interested me.
2. When: During my final 2 years of high school, around 3 years ago. 
3. Good: Allowed me to discover my passion in design and gave me the assignments to explore my capabilities.
4. Favourite Memory: The few times when I stayed up late to finish the projects. The relief I felt after submitting it at 2 am is so good.
5. Didn't Enjoy: Lack connections with classmates and only one or two people I can talk to in school.
6. Grade: C, it's alright. Honestly, I didn't enjoy that two years, but I didn't give it a 'F' just because that two years helped me to develop my skills that will benefit me academically and professionally in the future.
